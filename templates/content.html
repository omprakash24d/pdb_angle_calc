          What is Dihedral Angles

          in a protein refers to the internal angle formed between two adjacent
          planes of the <strong>polypeptide backbone</strong>. The backbone
          connects amino acids through peptide bonds, forming a chain. The shape
          of this backbone, how it bends and twists, determines the overall
          structure and function of the protein.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black">
          The backbone between two neighboring <strong>Cα atoms</strong> lies in
          a single plane, and the conformation of the backbone can be described
          using two dihedral angles for each amino acid residue. These angles
          are called <strong>φ (phi)</strong> and <strong>ψ (psi)</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-black">
          <li>
            <strong>φ (phi)</strong>: Involves the atoms
            <strong>C-N-Cα-C</strong>, describing the rotation around the bond
            between the nitrogen and the Cα atom.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ψ (psi)</strong>: Involves the atoms
            <strong>N-Cα-C-N</strong>, describing the rotation around the bond
            between the Cα atom and the carbonyl carbon.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-black">
          The values of φ and ψ are restricted by
          <strong>steric hindrance</strong>, which happens when atoms interfere
          with each other’s space. Atoms such as the
          <strong>carbonyl oxygen</strong>,
          <strong>hydrogen of the NH group</strong>, and
          <strong>side-chain atoms</strong> limit the angles, ensuring the
          protein folds into a stable and functional shape.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black">
          The way a protein folds is influenced by these dihedral angles.
          <strong>Proteins must adopt specific shapes</strong> to perform their
          biological functions, such as catalyzing reactions or binding to other
          molecules. By studying φ and ψ angles, scientists can predict how
          proteins will fold and their functions.

        <h3 class="mt-3 text-black fw-bold">What Is a Ramachandran Plot?</h3>
        <p class="text-black">
          A <strong>Ramachandran plot</strong> is a graphical tool used to
          visualize the relationship between φ and ψ angles in a protein. It
          helps researchers understand the allowed and forbidden regions of
          these angles, showing which combinations are physically possible in
          protein structures.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black">
          The plot has key regions corresponding to the two most common protein
          conformations:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-black">
          <li>
            <strong>Alpha helix (α helix)</strong>: Found around the coordinates
            <strong>(-60, -50)</strong> in the plot. This structure forms a
            right-handed spiral.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Beta sheet (β sheet)</strong>: Found around
            <strong>(-120, 120)</strong>. The protein backbone forms flat,
            extended sheets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Left-handed α helix</strong>: A rare structure, found around
            <strong>(60, 60)</strong> in the plot.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-black mt-3">
          By analyzing a Ramachandran plot, researchers can verify if a
          protein’s conformation is stable and realistic, ensuring that proteins
          fold correctly to perform their functions.
